# Antenna Effect
### In the field of integrated circuit (IC) fabrication, antenna effect is an important concept that needs to be understood and tackled effectively. This phenomenon occurs during plasma etching or dry etching, where metal or poly materials tend to accumulate charges that can subsequently flow through the gate oxide and damage it. As a result, this effect is known as Antenna Effect, as it resembles the behavior of an antenna in capturing charges.
